## Data Structure

The dataset is obtained from a Quarterly Census of Emplyment and Wages (OCEW) from the past decade. 
It can be found here: 
<a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/quarterly-census-of-employment-and-wages-qcew"> Quarterly Census of Emplyment and Wages (OCEW) </a>

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty

*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
